          The company owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and
          WhatsApp, among other products and services.[14] Meta ranks among the
          largest American information technology companies, alongside other Big
          Five corporations Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. The
          company was ranked #31 on the Forbes Global 2000 ranking in 2023.[15]
          Meta has also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality
          Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms; the
          company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such as the
          discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and presently partners
          with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of
          smartglasses.[16][17] Despite endeavors into hardware, the company
          relies on advertising for a vast majority of its revenue, amounting to
          97.8 percent in 2023.[18] Parent company Facebook, Inc. rebranded as
          Meta Platforms, Inc. on October 28, 2021, to "reflect its focus on
          building the metaverse",[19] an integrated environment linking the
          company's products and services.[20][21][22] History Further

          vte Facebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1,
          2012.[23] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to
          raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website
          accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[24] After the IPO,
          Zuckerberg would retain 22% of the total shares and 57% of the total
          voting power in Facebook.[25] Underwriters valued the shares at $38
          each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to
          date for a newly public company.[26] On May 16, one day before the
          IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally
          planned due to high demand.[27] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it
          the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Mobility and
          behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company
          with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S.
          corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's,
          Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19
          billion.[28][29] The New York Times stated that the offering overcame
          questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to
          transform the company into a "must-own stock". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan
          Chase described it as "the next great blue-chip".[28] Writers at
          TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, "That's
          a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add
          bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation."[30]
          Trading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due
          to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[31] The stock
          struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing
          underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[32] At the
          closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[33] only $0.23 above the
          IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was
          widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[34] The
          stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[35]
          On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at
          $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[36] On May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall
          Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they
          had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had
          improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the
          general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin
          subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[37] The allegations
          sparked "fury" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of
          several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than
          $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[38] Bloomberg estimated that
          retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook
          stock since its debut.[39] S&P Global Ratings added Facebook to its
          S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[40] On May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg
          announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from
          "Move fast and break things" to "Move fast with stable
          infrastructure".[41][42] The earlier motto had been described as
          Zuckerberg's "prime directive to his developers and team" in a 2009
          interview in Business Insider, in which he also said, "Unless you are
          breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough."[43]
